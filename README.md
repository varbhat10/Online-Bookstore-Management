# Online-Bookstore-Management
My Online Bookstore Management System is a web based application designed to facilitate the management of a bookstore's inventory, customers, orders, and authors. The application allows administrators to perform CRUD operations on the bookstore's database. The system is implemented using Node.js for the backend and a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend.
